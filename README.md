✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Objectives
This project is an Express x NextJS application that fetches data from the public Flickr API to display a grid of photos to the user. Users can also search for images by tags.

Extra features include light/dark mode, defaulted to the user's system setting, and the option to share an individual photo on whatsapp directly from the web interface.

The app has been built leveraging NX Monorepos to host both the api and the interface in the same repository, and the two ends are hosted on Vercel. The stack employed is Typescript x Node x Express for the backend, and NextJS x Tailwind x Shadcn for the frontend.


## Usage
To use the app, download it on your machine with `git clone git@github.com:francescamilk/miyagami-francesca-santoriello.git`,
then navigate to the project folder and install the dependencies running `npm install`.

To serve the application locally, run `npm run dev` in the root directory: 
this will boot the API on http://localhost:3000/api/v1/photos, and the UI on http://localhost:4200.

- Code for the backend to be found in apps/api/
- Code for the frontend to be found in apps/client
- Shared types and libraries to be found in libs/
